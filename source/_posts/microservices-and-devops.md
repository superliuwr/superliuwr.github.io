# Microservices

## Shared Code

## Container

## Database

## Middlewares
### Pub/Sub

### Queue

## Security

## Reliability

## Health Check

## Service Discovery

## Load Balancing

## Configuration centre

## Logging

## Metrics

## Monitoring

## Circuit Breaker

## Distributed Tracing

# Key Points to validate

* How many Microservices should I divide the business capabilities into thinking in terms of domain driven design.
* Partitioning the data into different services with their own database solution with the understanding of which segment of data needs to be kept redundant locally for each of these services.
* How data is synchronized between Microservices for redundant data.
* Consistency requirements of data. (Whether its transactional requiring strong consistency vs possibility of implementing eventual consistency).
* Selection of right interfaces, channels, and middleware for communications and interaction between services.
* Required level of Security, Reliability, Performance, and Efficiency thinking the costs in mind.
* Tools and technologies to be used for individual Microservices. (Serverless, Containers, Web Technologies & etc.)
* How to version and share code (If required) in the form of libraries using repositories like NPM.
* How the teams and processes (Development, DevOps, Change Management & etc.) are structured around Microservices.
