# Overview

## Cloud computing deployment modes
* all-in cloud-based application deployment
* hybrid deployment

## Regions, Availability Zones and Edge locations
* AWS Management Console
* CLI
* SDKs

AWS provides a highly available technology infrastructure platform with multiple locations worldwide. These locations are composed of regions and Availability Zones. Each **region** is a separate geographic area. Each region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones. AWS enables the placement of resources and data in multiple locations. Resources arenâ€™t replicated across regions unless organizations choose to do so.

Each region is completely independent and is designed to be completely isolated from the other regions. This achieves the greatest possible fault tolerance and stability. Each **Availability Zone** is also isolated, but the Availability Zones in a region are connected through low-latency links.

An **Edge location** is a CDN or Content Delivery Network endpoint for CloudFront.
